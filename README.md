# Web Server
create Web-server by using java language and test the web server with html successful page( 200 )and with html error page( 404 ).
This code contains :
1- httprequest class
2- httpresponse class
3- Connection class
4- Min class
5- test.html
6- notfound.html
## In the first step, to create a server  at port number:4321 ; I create object from serversocket class in Min class. And I accept the connection from the client (browser).
## In the second step, I use a connection class to create a multithread http server.
##	In the third step, I use httprequest class to get the request from the browser.
##	In the fourth step, I use httpresponce class to read the file.
##	In the fifth step, I use the test.html as a test file to show me how the response is successful. And I will use notfound.html as test file to show me how the response is failed and the page is not found.
